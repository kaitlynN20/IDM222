## CSS3 Features

- transitions
- transformations
- animations
- filters

---

## CSS Transitions

^ _Transitions_ let you gradually change one or more of the CSS properties for an element over a specified period of time. As you'll see, transitions let you provide features with CSS3 alone that would otherwise require JavaScript and jQuery.

---

## CSS Transitions

    transition                  shorthand
    transition-property         property(s) used
    transition-duration         (milli)seconds
    transition-timing-function  speed curve
    transition-delay            (milli)seconds before start

^ Here are the five properties that can be used for transitions. The shorthand _transition_ property is the easiest to code. The _transition-property_ specifies the property(s) that the transition is for. Use commas to separate multiple CSS properties. The _transition-duration_ specifies the seconds or milliseconds that the transition will take. The _transition-timing-function_ specifies the speed curve of the transition. Values include: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out and cubic-bezier. The _transition-delay_ specifies the seconds or milliseconds before the transition starts.

---

## The Syntax

```
transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
```

```css
a {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 100%;
  transition: color 2s ease-in 1s,
              font-size 2s ease-out 1s;
}
a:hover {
  color: red;
  font-size: 120%;
}
```

^ This is the CSS syntax for coding the shorthand _transition_ property for any element. In this first example we use a transition for the change in two properties that are applied to an `a` element: color and font-size. The rule set for the `a` selector sets the font-size to 100% and the color to blue. Then the shorthand transition property provides two sets of values that are separated by commas.

---

## The Syntax

```css
a {
  transition: color 2s ease-in 1s,
              font-size 2s ease-out 1s;
}
```

^ The first set of values is for the color property. It says that the transition should take two seconds, use the _ease-in_ timing function (or speed curve), and wait one second before starting. The second is for the font-size property and is basically the same other than the timing function here will _ease-out_.

---

## The Syntax

```css
a {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 100%;
  transition: color 2s ease-in 1s,
              font-size 2s ease-out 1s;
}
a:hover {
  color: red;
  font-size: 120%;
}
```

^ The rule set is followed by one for the hover pseudo-class for the `a` element.

---

## The Syntax

```css
a:hover {
  color: red;
  font-size: 120%;
}
```

^ It changes the color to red, and the font-size to 120%. This means when the user hovers the mouse over the anchor element, the two values in the transition are changed. As a result, the transition takes place. When the user stops hovering, the transition returns to the original state.

^ Let's test this in a browser. (_week2/01-transitions.html_)

## Great...

[Can I Use It?](http://caniuse.com#feat=css-transitions)

^ Whenever CSS3 techniques are being used, it's important to check current browser support information so you know where your techniques will work, and where you have to work around lack of support or feature bugs.

---

## Practical Application

^ Adding transitions is a great way to give your content more personality and provide the user a more enjoyable experience. Transitions can also help with functionality, and provide a simpler, faster method of programming. Let's look at another example. (_week2/02-transitions-accordian.html_)

---

## CSS Transforms

_Transforms_ let your rotate, scale, skew and position HTML elements using CSS code.

When you combine transforms with transitions, you can create some interesting animations for your HTML elements.

---

## 2D Transforms

    transform          Applies transform methods
    transform-origin   Changes the default origin point

^ The transform property lets you apply one or more transforms to an HTML element. The transform-origin property lets you change the origin point for the transform. Methods for 2D transformations include rotate, scale, skew, translate and matrix (which let your do all the other methods in a single method).

---

## 2D Transforms

```html
<p>
  <img src="image01.jpg"><img src="image01.jpg" class="image">
</p>
```

```css
.image {
  transition: 2s;
}
.image:hover {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

^ In this example, there are two copies of the same image displayed side by side. Then, when the user hovers the mouse over the image on the right, it is rotated 180 degrees. As a result, it looks like a mirror image of the image on the left. (_week2/03-transform.html_)

---

## Learning Transforms

^ The best way to understand what these transforms can do is to experiment. Let's look at some more examples of 2D transformations. (**open** _week2/04-transform-gallery.html_)

## CSS Animations

![](https://0bf196087c14ed19d1f11cf1-ambercreativelab.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/animated-headline-effect-preview.gif)

^ CSS3 _animations_ let you create frame-based animations that are similar to what you might create with a program like Flash. They can be simple or complex and can animate more than one CSS property at the same time.

---

## CSS Animations

    animation                 shorthand
    animation-name            name of the @keframes rule
    animation-duration        (milli)seconds length
    animation-delay           (milli)seconds before start
    animation-iteration-count repeat count
    animation-timing-function speed of the curve
    animation-direction       normal, reverse, or alternate

^ Of the six values that the animation property can include, the values for duration, delay and timing function work the same as they do for a transition. The value for iteration count is the number of times the animation should be run. And the value for direction is the direction in which the animation should be run. The other value is the _@keyframes_ selector rule. Within this rule you define the keyframes for the animation sequence.

---

## CSS Animations

```css
h1 {
  animation: [name]
             [duration]
             [timing-function]
             [delay]
             [iteration-count]
             [direction]
}
```

^ This is the shorthand syntax for the property.

---

```css
h1 {
  animation: moveright 3s 2s infinite ease-in-out alternate;
}

@keyframes moveright {
  from {
    color: blue;
    margin-left: 20%;
  }
  to {
    color: red;
    margin-left: 60%;
  }
}
```

^ In this example, the color and left margin are changed over a duration of three seconds. The result is the animation moves the heading from left to right and changes the color from blue to red. The animation property for the `h1` element points to _moveright_. It also says each repetition should take three seconds, the start of the animation should be delayed two seconds, the animation should keep repeating using the _ease-in-out_ speed curve and that the first animation will move left to right, the second from right to left, and so on.

---

```css
@keyframes moveright {
  from {
    color: blue;
    margin-left: 20%;
  }
  to {
    color: red;
    margin-left: 60%;
  }
}
```

^ The _@keyframes_ selector rule illustrates one way that the keyframes can be defined. You use the _from_ group to set the properties for the first frame and the _to_ group to set the properties for the last frame. The browser fills in the "in-between" frames for you. This is known as _tweening_. Let's build our example. (_week2/05-animation-fade.html_)

---

## CSS Animations

```css
@keyframes myAnimation {
  0% {}
  50% {}
  100% {}
}
```

^ For a finer level of control, your _keyframes_ can be setup using various percentage points. Let's build another example. (_week2/06-animation.html_)

---

## CSS Filters

^ _Filters_ let you change the appearance of images after they've been loaded into the browser without changing the image files. You can convert an image to grayscale or blur an image.

---

## CSS Filters

```css
image {
  filter: [filtermethod(value)];
}
```

^ There are various filters available. We'll look at a couple examples here. Research online to find a full list of available filters and the values that are accepted for each.

## Master Your Editor

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*9qGFK0jjigADvy4BF_PZ_A.jpeg)

^ A big part of web development is workflow. Knowing how to code is critical; but also know how to code quickly, accurately, consistently and in a fashion where your code is readable, reliable and re-useable all make you a more valuable developer. You need to be a master of your code, and a master of the tools you use to create your code. Knowing your editor inside and out will let you focus more on the code and less on writing it.

^ No matter what editor you use, there is probably a fair amount of customizing that can be done to make your environment work to your personal preferences. Let's take a look at Sublime Text more closely and some of the built in functionality already available.
